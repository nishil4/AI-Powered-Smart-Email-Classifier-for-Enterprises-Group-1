# 📧 AI-Powered Smart Email Intelligence System

## 🚀 Project Overview

Enterprises receive thousands of emails daily, including customer complaints, support requests, promotions, updates, and spam. Manually triaging these emails is inefficient and delays response times.

This project builds an end-to-end AI-powered email intelligence system that:

- Automatically classifies emails into 6 categories
- Detects urgency levels (High / Medium / Low)
- Provides an interactive analytics dashboard for monitoring and filtering emails

The solution improves operational efficiency by prioritizing critical emails and reducing manual workload.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Lowercasing text
- Removing special characters
- Whitespace normalization
- Creation of clean_text column
- Handling class imbalance

### 2️⃣ Text Vectorization

- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- 10,000 max features
- Sparse high-dimensional representation

### 3️⃣ Model Architecture

- Logistic Regression (multi-class classification)
- Class weighting for urgency detection
- Model persistence using Pickle
